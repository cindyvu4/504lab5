      <h1>Fatality rate of Covid-19 by country</h1>

<p> Data do not always accurately reflect the state of the world we are in. In the bar chart, it appears that the US has the highest fatality rate than any other country as of March 4th, but this is wrong! This is due to the US slow response to the Covid-19 crisis. Testing was not done until recently when other parts of the world have been testing thousands of people a day. Which means more people are being treated and can recover. This will make data ramp up quickly and will appear that US fatality rate skyrocketed. When seeing data on charts and graphs it seems reliable and true, but people have to source-check their infomation - dig for the cause and not just believe everything they see.
