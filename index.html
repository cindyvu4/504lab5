<p> <b>Types</b> are properties of the Pokemon and their moves. There are eighteen different Types of Pokemon as shown in the chart, and each Type has its own strengths and weaknesses through logical setups. For example, a Fire-type Pokemon are weak against a Water-Type Pokemon. Pokemon can have up to two Types, making them a Dual-Type Pokemon. There are 324 possible ways to assign Types to Pokemon, with 171 unique combinations.
